## Overview
This repository documents the collaborative internship project conducted in partnership with Fraunhofer Austria and JOANNEUM RESEARCH. The objective of the project was to design, program, and test a miniature scale conveyor belt system. The git focused on developing software to control the conveyor belts using an Arduino Nano and logging data onto an Adafruit Feather M0.

## Features
- Two-belted conveyor belt system controlled by an Arduino Nano with two Stepper Motors.
- Data logging functionality using Adafruit Feather M0 and multiple sensors.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `arduinoCode/` contains the Arduino code for controlling the conveyor belts and logging the data.
- `images/` includes images
- `measurements/` holds CSV and Excel files along with images of graphs.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the Arduino environment and load the source code onto your Arduino board.
